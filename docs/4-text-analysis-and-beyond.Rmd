# Agenda

### Part 1: Getting up and running
### Part 2: Visualizing and exploring data
### Part 3: Modeling and understanding data
### *Part 4: Doing more with data science*

# Text analysis

- Text analysis is an example of a data science technique that *may* be useful to you
- A bit on the epistemology of work with data:
   - We're accustomed to thinking of data as that which is stored in rows and columns in spreadsheets
   - But, not all data takes this form
- What data we collect, how we decide to collect it, and how we analyze it are decisions that we make
- Think about the kinds of data you want to collect---and why---to answer the questions *you* want to answer

---

# Text analysis 

*Let's hop over to the demo doc for part 4!* (optional)

# Getting help

- Try to find out what the specific problem is
  -  Identify what is *not* causing the problem
- Highly-recommended: RStudio Community - https://community.rstudio.com/
- Reach out to each other---sharing what is causing an issue can often help to clarify the problem
- "Unplug and plug it back in" - restart R, close and reopen R
- Seek out workshops and other learning opportunities
- Consider using RStudio Cloud 
- Reach out to your faculty; it is so great that you're learning R
- Reach out to me!
