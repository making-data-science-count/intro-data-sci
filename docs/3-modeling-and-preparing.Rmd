# Regression

# Linear (regression) models

- Think about a linear (regression) model as a way to answer the question: *What is related to some outcome or result I care about?*
- *Dependent variable*: An outcome or result
- *Independent variable*: The thing(s) that relate to the outcome or result you crae about
- Sometimes, a regression with a single dependent variable and a single independent variable is called a single regression, and one with more than one independent variable is called a multiple regression

---

# Single regression example

```{r}
m1 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent, data = sci_mo_processed)
summary(m1)
```

---

# Multiple regression example

Note: int refers to students' interest

```{r}
m2 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent + int, data = sci_mo_processed)
summary(m2)
```

---

# Multiple regression example

Dummy-coding is a powerful (but easy in R ) technique; recall
that subject is a group---a factor

```{r, eval = FALSE}
m3 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent + int + subject, data = sci_mo_processed)
summary(m3)
```

# Try it out! Linear models

*Let's hop over to the demo doc for part 3!*

- `lm()` (for linear model)
- reading and (especially) writing data
- multi-level models (leap)

---

# *Discuss in groups!*

- What challenges did you face?
- What successes did you face?
- What questions do you still have?
