# Agenda

### Part 1: Getting up and running
### *Part 2: Visualizing and exploring data*
### Part 3: Modeling and understanding data
### Part 4: Doing more with data science

# ggplot2

- based on the "grammar of graphics"
- a popular R package (ggplot2)
- flexible and fun to use
- requires you to think about what you what to visualize in what ways

# Example ggplot2 plot

```{r}
sci_mo_processed %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percentage_earned, y = TimeSpent)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

# Example ggplot2 plot

```{r}
sci_mo_processed %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = percentage_earned, y = TimeSpent)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

# Try it out! ggplot2 

*Let's hop over to the demo doc for part 2!*

An introduction to ggplot2  
Exploring data  
Beyond the basics  

---

# *Discuss in groups! (five minutes in groups, five minutes together)*

- What challenges did you face?
- What successes did you face?
- What questions do you still have?
